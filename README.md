> Like npm for local AI agent skills: one install, many coding agents.

`aweskill` is a local skill package manager for AI agents such as Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Windsurf, OpenCode, and more.

It helps developers find, install, update, bundle, deduplicate, back up, and reuse skills across multiple AI coding tools.

Instead of copying the same `SKILL.md` folders into every tool by hand, `aweskill` keeps one central source of truth in `~/.aweskill/skills/` and projects selected skills into each agent's expected directory using `symlink`, junction, or managed `copy`.

> **Website:** [aweskill.wehuman.top](https://aweskill.wehuman.top/) — project homepage with install guides and agent compatibility overview.

## Quick Start

`aweskill` is designed for a simple loop: install the CLI once, equip your agent with the built-in management skills, then let the agent operate aweskill for day-to-day work.

### 1. Install aweskill

If you are working inside Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or another coding agent, just hand the whole job to it — the agent installs the CLI, initializes the store, and projects the built-in skills. Invoke skills (`/` in Claude Code, `$` in Codex) afterwards to confirm the new skills appear; if not, restart the agent first.

You can tell your agent:

```text
Read https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill/blob/main/README.ai.md and follow it to install aweskill for this agent.
```

Working outside a coding agent and prefer to do it yourself? Install globally with npm (requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or later), then initialize the central store — the commands are in the folded blocks below.

Package page: [npmjs.com/package/aweskill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aweskill)

<details>
<summary>Install and bootstrap CLI commands</summary>

```bash
# Install aweskill and initialize the central store
npm install -g aweskill
aweskill store init

# Show where the aweskill store lives
aweskill store where --verbose
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example agent-assisted install screenshot</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Other install methods: this repository, GitHub dev branch, local dev link, packed tarball</summary>

```bash
# Install from this repository
npm install
npm run build
npm install -g .

# Install the dev version from GitHub (dev branch contains in-progress changes and may be unstable)
npm install -g wehuman01/aweskill#dev

# Local development link
npm install
npm link
aweskill --help

# Install from a packed tarball
npm install
npm pack
npm install -g ./aweskill-<version>.tgz
```

</details>

### 2. Equip your agent

If you just installed aweskill by hand, one step remains: project the three built-in management skills into your current agent — `aweskill` for day-to-day operations, `aweskill-doctor` for diagnosis and repair, and `aweskill-creator` for authoring (see [Built-In Agent Skills](#built-in-agent-skills) for what each covers). Agent-assisted installs complete this step automatically.

You can tell your agent:

```text
List the supported agent ids, then project aweskill, aweskill-doctor, and aweskill-creator into codex's global skills directory.
```

<details>
<summary>Equivalent CLI commands</summary>

```bash
# See supported agent ids
aweskill agent supported

# Project the built-in management skills into your current agent
aweskill agent add skill aweskill,aweskill-doctor,aweskill-creator --global --agent codex

# Verify the current projected state
aweskill agent list --global --agent codex
```

</details>

Replace `codex` with your agent id.

### 3. Use aweskill through natural language

From here on, day-to-day use needs no memorized commands: state the intent and the agent enters the matching aweskill workflow. The six common scenarios follow — each opens with the intent and the outcome in plain language; expand the folded block to run the CLI by hand or verify exactly what happens.

#### Bring existing skills under management

If you already have skills scattered across Claude Code, Codex, and other tools, aweskill can scan those directories and bring the unmanaged ones into the central store as the single source of truth going forward. Scanning only discovers and reports; importing happens after you confirm. On import, the original directory is replaced by a symlink into the central store by default (original files can be kept instead).

You can tell your agent:

```text
Bring the skills already in my Claude Code directories into aweskill.
```

<details>
<summary>Equivalent CLI commands</summary>

```bash
# Scan agent skill directories (dry-run: only discover)
aweskill store scan

# Scan and import all discovered skills
aweskill store scan --import

# Scan and import with detailed output
aweskill store scan --import --verbose

# Scan and import, overwriting existing skills
aweskill store scan --import --override

# Scan and import, keeping originals instead of replacing with symlinks
aweskill store scan --import --keep-source

# Scan specific agent only
aweskill store scan --import --agent claude
```

</details>

#### Find, install, and keep skills up to date

When you need a new skill, have the agent search skills.sh and sciskillhub.org together, or only the local central store: remote results come with a source `aweskill store install` can use directly, and local results point at the skill path. Installs record their source, so one command later checks or refreshes updates while your local edits in the central store stay protected. Peek at a skill with `store show` before installing or updating.

You can tell your agent:

```text
Find a proteomics skill and install it; then check whether my installed skills have source updates.
```

<details>
<summary>Equivalent CLI commands</summary>

```bash
# Search both skills.sh and sciskillhub.org
aweskill find protein

# Search one provider only
aweskill find protein --provider sciskill

# Search the local central store and print matching skill paths
aweskill find review --local

# Inspect one local skill summary
aweskill store show paper-review

# Print the full markdown or just the path
aweskill store show paper-review --raw
aweskill store show paper-review --path

# Install a skill from a GitHub-style source discovered via skills.sh
aweskill store install owner/repo

# Install a scientific skill from sciskillhub.org
aweskill store install sciskill:open-source/research/lifesciences-proteomics

# Check tracked installs for updates without changing files
aweskill store update --check

# Refresh one tracked skill from its recorded source
aweskill store update lifesciences-proteomics
```

</details>

#### Create a new skill

Making a skill follows the same lifecycle as installing one: scaffold into the central store, iterate, validate, project, and publish when it is good enough.

You can tell your agent:

```text
Make me a skill for reviewing papers: scaffold it, write the trigger description, and project it to Codex.
```

<details>
<summary>Equivalent CLI commands</summary>

```bash
# Check whether a similar skill already exists before writing a new one
aweskill find review
aweskill find review --local

# Scaffold a new skill with valid SKILL.md frontmatter and references/
aweskill store create paper-review --description "Use when reviewing academic papers, checking citations, or summarizing manuscripts. 中文触发词：论文评审、审稿、文献总结。"

# Draft the skill: edit the generated SKILL.md body at
# ~/.aweskill/skills/paper-review/SKILL.md and add on-demand docs under references/

# Validate the frontmatter (dry-run by default)
aweskill doctor fix-skills --skill paper-review

# Project and iterate; projections are symlinks, so edits go live instantly
aweskill agent add skill paper-review --global --agent codex
```

</details>

A few notes:

- With the built-in `aweskill-creator` skill projected, you can just ask your agent to "make me a skill for X" — it interviews you, checks for existing skills, scaffolds, drafts, tests with realistic prompts, validates, and projects
- For a repo-specific skill shared through git, scaffold into the repo instead and bring it into the store later: `aweskill store create my-skill --dir <repo>/.agents/skills`, then `aweskill store install <path>` on each machine
- To publish, copy the finished skill directory into its own git repo; others install it with `aweskill install owner/repo`
- Created skills are not source-tracked (like `scan --import`), so `store update` never overwrites your edits

#### Group skills into reusable bundles

When the same skills always travel together — a project's stack, a team's standard workflow — group them into a bundle and project or remove the whole set at once instead of naming skills one by one. Bundles live in `~/.aweskill/bundles/*.yaml` and can be shared through git.

You can tell your agent:

```text
Create a backend bundle with api-design and db-schema in it.
```

<details>
<summary>Equivalent CLI commands</summary>

```bash
# Create a reusable bundle
aweskill bundle create backend

# Add multiple skills into the bundle
aweskill bundle add backend api-design,db-schema

# Inspect what the bundle contains
aweskill bundle show backend
```

</details>

#### Project skills into agents

A skill takes effect only once it is projected into the target agent's skill directory — the projected state is the activation state. Project a single skill, several skills, or a whole bundle, into one agent or every detected agent. Projections are symlinks by default, so edits in the central store go live instantly. Disable a projection with `agent remove`, and when you no longer want aweskill to manage things at all, `agent recover` turns the symlinks back into full directories.

You can tell your agent:

```text
Project the backend bundle to Codex and Cursor.
```

<details>
<summary>Equivalent CLI commands</summary>

```bash
# Project one skill into detected global agent directories
aweskill agent add skill biopython

# Project multiple skills into one specific global agent directory
aweskill agent add skill biopython,scanpy --global --agent codex

# Project a whole bundle into every detected global agent directory
aweskill agent add bundle backend --global --agent all

# Turn managed symlinks back into full directories
aweskill agent recover --global --agent codex
```

</details>

#### Inspect, repair, and back up

Local state drifts over time: broken projections, duplicate entries, suspicious files, malformed frontmatter. The doctor commands handle these — they all default to dry run, only `--apply` makes real changes, and rewrites or moves can back up the originals first. The central store as a whole can be archived with `store backup` and restored with `store restore` at any time.

You can tell your agent:

```text
Inspect my Codex skills for broken or duplicate projections, but do not modify anything yet.
```

<details>
<summary>Equivalent CLI commands</summary>

```bash
# Inspect the central store layout and entry counts
aweskill store where --verbose

# Create a backup archive of the current store
aweskill store backup

# Restore a backup archive into the current store
aweskill store restore ~/Downloads/aweskill-backup.tar.gz

# Inspect agent entries and categories
aweskill agent list

# Remove suspicious entries from the central store
aweskill doctor clean

# Move duplicate central-store skills into dup_skills
aweskill doctor dedup --apply

# Back up duplicates before moving them into dup_skills
aweskill doctor dedup --apply --backup

# Back up malformed SKILL.md files before rewriting them
aweskill doctor fix-skills --apply --backup

# Inspect repair actions for one agent
aweskill doctor sync --global --agent codex

# Repair broken / duplicate / matched agent entries for one agent
aweskill doctor sync --global --agent codex --apply

# Remove suspicious agent entries only when explicitly requested
aweskill doctor sync --global --agent codex --apply --remove-suspicious
```

`aweskill doctor fix-skills` reports two groups of categories:

- Actionable fixes: `missing-closing-delimiter` adds the missing frontmatter closing fence, `invalid-yaml` rebuilds broken frontmatter from recoverable fields and body text, `added-frontmatter` inserts minimal frontmatter when the file starts with body content, `normalized-name` restores a usable canonical skill name, and `normalized-description` restores a usable description from the first body sentence.
- Informational checks: `normalized-required-permissions` reports permissions that could be normalized into the canonical list form, `preserved-unknown-fields` reports frontmatter fields outside the built-in core set, and `removed-empty-fields` reports blank arrays, objects, or scalar values that could be dropped.

See [docs/fix-skills-categories.md](docs/fix-skills-categories.md) for full details and before/after examples.

## FAQ

### Why aweskill, and who is it for?

`aweskill` is for developers and teams who use more than one AI agent, maintain reusable `SKILL.md` folders or agent instructions, and want one local source of truth instead of copying the same skills into every tool. It is especially useful when the problem is not only distribution, but also ongoing repair: broken projections, duplicate skills, suspicious entries, stale links, and malformed `SKILL.md` files that accumulate over time.

- **One central store** for all your local skills in `~/.aweskill/skills/`
- **Search, install, and update loop** across [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/), [sciskillhub.org](https://sciskillhub.org/), GitHub-style sources, and local paths
- **Multi-agent projection** across Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Windsurf, OpenCode, and more
- **Doctor workflows for real local mess** such as broken projections, duplicate entries, suspicious files, malformed frontmatter, and drift between agent directories and the central store
- **Bundle-based organization** for reusable skill sets by project, team, workflow, or agent
- **Managed enable/disable model** with plug-and-play projection instead of manually copying folders into each tool
- **Agent-callable management, repair, and authoring skills** so AI agents can run `aweskill`, `aweskill-doctor`, and `aweskill-creator` workflows from natural-language requests
- **Backup, restore, deduplication, cleanup, sync repair, and recovery** in one local CLI workflow

<details>
<summary>More FAQ</summary>

### Where does aweskill store skills?

`aweskill` stores managed skills in `~/.aweskill/skills/`.

### Can aweskill share skills between Claude Code and Codex?

Yes. `aweskill` keeps one central copy of a skill and projects it into each agent's expected skill directory.

### Do projected skills work inside git worktrees?

By default `aweskill` writes **relative** symlinks, which resolve only at the depth they were created for. If you commit projected skills into git and check them out into a nested git worktree, the relative target can dangle. Run `aweskill agent add … --absolute` (or set `AWESKILL_ABSOLUTE_SYMLINKS=1` to make it the default) to write **absolute** symlink targets that resolve at any depth, so the same committed projection works in the main checkout and in nested worktrees. Note the tradeoff: an absolute target hard-codes this machine's `~/.aweskill` path, so it will dangle on another machine or in CI where the home directory differs — use it only when the same checkout is reused at varying depths on one machine.

### Does aweskill support Cursor and Gemini CLI?

Yes. `aweskill` supports skill projection for Cursor, Gemini CLI, and many other AI agents.

### Is aweskill local-first?

Yes. `aweskill` manages skills on your local machine and does not require a hosted service.

### Can AI agents call aweskill directly?

Yes. `aweskill` ships built-in management skills for `aweskill` and `aweskill-doctor`; after installing or projecting those skills, an AI agent can follow natural-language requests to search, install, update, bundle, repair, deduplicate, clean, sync, or project skills by running aweskill commands.

### What makes aweskill different once the local skill state gets messy?

`aweskill` does not stop at install-and-project. It also gives you a repair path when local state drifts:

- **`doctor sync`** inspects or repairs broken, stale, duplicate, matched, new, external, and suspicious agent entries
- **`doctor clean`** finds suspicious non-store files in managed areas before they silently accumulate
- **`doctor dedup`** helps reconcile duplicate skills without forcing blind deletion
- **`doctor fix-skills`** repairs malformed `SKILL.md` frontmatter and can back up originals first
- **`agent list` as a dry-run view** lets you inspect repair state before applying changes

### How does aweskill handle find, install, and update?

`aweskill` combines local orchestration with a source-aware skill lifecycle:

- **Find** skills across [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/), [sciskillhub.org](https://sciskillhub.org/), or the local central store with one command
- **Install** skills from GitHub-style sources, local paths, or `sciskill:<skill-id>` identifiers into the central store
- **Update** tracked installs from their recorded sources while protecting local central-store edits
- **Project** the same managed skills into Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and other agents

### What is the difference between `scan` and `install`?

Both commands add skills to the central store, but serve different purposes:

| | `store scan --import` | `store install` |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary use** | Batch discovery from agent directories | Single skill from GitHub, local path, or sciskill |
| **Source tracking** | No (one-time import) | Yes (automatic, enables `update`) |
| **Key flags** | `--override`, `--verbose`, `--scope`, `--agent` | `--skill`, `--all`, `--ref`, `--as` |
| **Typical command** | `aweskill store scan --import` | `aweskill store install owner/repo` |

Use `scan --import` for initial setup — discover and import skills from existing agent directories. Use `install` for ongoing management — install individual skills with source tracking for future updates.

`sciskill` here refers to the public registry-metadata repository under `sciskillhub`, not a local skill-manager CLI.

Use `aweskill` when your main problem is not just installing a skill once, but maintaining a reusable local skill inventory across multiple AI agents over time and keeping that local state repairable when it inevitably gets messy.

## Built-In Agent Skills

`aweskill` works best when your coding agent can operate it directly.

Project the built-in `aweskill`, `aweskill-doctor`, and `aweskill-creator` skills into your agent first:

- `aweskill` covers day-to-day operations such as `find`, `install`, `update`, `bundle`, and `agent add`
- `aweskill-doctor` covers repair-first workflows such as `doctor sync`, `doctor clean`, `doctor dedup`, `doctor fix-skills`, and `agent recover`
- `aweskill-creator` covers authoring workflows: scaffold a new skill with `store create`, draft it, test it, validate it, and project it
- Without projecting them, an agent can still run shell commands, but it will not have the built-in skill guidance that makes aweskill workflows easier to discover and apply from natural-language requests

<details>
<summary>Install the built-in skills into the central store</summary>

```bash
aweskill store install resources/skills/aweskill
aweskill store install resources/skills/aweskill-doctor
aweskill store install resources/skills/aweskill-creator
```

</details>

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for skill directory structure and design principles.

## Core Model

`aweskill` keeps one central skill store in `~/.aweskill/skills/`, groups reusable skills through bundles, and projects selected skills into each agent's own skill directory. That projected filesystem state is the activation model.

## What It Supports

Supported agents currently include:

`adal`, `amp`, `antigravity`, `augment`, `bob`, `claude-code`, `cline`, `codebuddy`, `command-code`, `continue`, `codex`, `copilot`, `cortex`, `crush`, `cursor`, `deepagents`, `droid`, `firebender`, `gemini-cli`, `github-copilot`, `goose`, `iflow-cli`, `junie`, `kilo`, `kilo-code`, `kimi-cli`, `kiro-cli`, `kode`, `mcpjam`, `mistral-vibe`, `mimo`, `mux`, `neovate`, `openclaw`, `openclaude-ide`, `openhands`, `opencode`, `pi`, `pochi`, `qoder`, `qwen-code`, `replit`, `roo`, `trae`, `trae-cn`, `warp`, `windsurf`, `workbuddy`, `zcode`, `zencoder`

Key directories:

- Central store: `~/.aweskill/skills/`
- Duplicate holding area: `~/.aweskill/dup_skills/`
- Backup root: `~/.aweskill/backup/`
- Dedup backup area: `~/.aweskill/backup/dedup/`
- fix-skills backup area: `~/.aweskill/backup/fix_skills/`
- Bundles: `~/.aweskill/bundles/*.yaml`
- Built-in skills: `resources/skills/aweskill/`, `resources/skills/aweskill-doctor/`

Discovery and install sources:

- [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) is used as a community discovery source and may return directly installable GitHub-style sources or discover-only entries that point you to the upstream skills.sh page
- [sciskillhub.org](https://sciskillhub.org/) is used as a scientific and technical skill registry and provides installable `sciskill:<skill-id>` sources
- The local central store is available as a `local` search provider and reads `~/.aweskill/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `aweskill find` searches `skills.sh` and `sciskill` by default, merges results by normalized name, and lets `--limit` apply per provider before merge and dedupe; use `--local` or `--provider local` to search only the local central store
- `aweskill store install` currently accepts local paths, GitHub sources, and `sciskill:<skill-id>` identifiers

## Command Surface

Core commands: `store init`, `store where`, `store scan`, `bundle create`, `agent add`, `doctor clean`

Top-level convenience commands are available for high-frequency search and tracked-source flows: `aweskill find`, `aweskill install`, and `aweskill update`.

| `aweskill store install <source> [--list] [--skill <name>] [--all] [--ref <ref>] [--as <name>] [--override]` | Install skills from a local path, GitHub source, or `sciskill:<skill-id>` into the central store and record them for future `store update` runs |
| `aweskill store update [skill...] [--check] [--prune] [--source <source>] [--override] [--verbose]` | Check or refresh tracked skills from their recorded source while treating the central store copy as the protected local state; `--prune` removes tracking for local-store entries that were already deleted |
| `aweskill store list [--verbose]` | List skills in the central store |
| `aweskill store show <skill> [--summary\|--raw\|--path]` | Show a central-store skill summary by default, print the full `SKILL.md`, or print only the `SKILL.md` path |
| `aweskill store remove <skill> [--force]` | Remove one skill from the central store and clean any tracked lock entry for that skill |
| `aweskill bundle list [--verbose]` | List central bundles |
| `aweskill bundle create <name>` | Create a bundle |
| `aweskill bundle add <bundle> <skill>` | Add one or more skills to a bundle |
| `aweskill bundle remove <bundle> <skill>` | Remove one or more skills from a bundle |
| `aweskill bundle show <name>` | Inspect bundle contents |
| `aweskill bundle template list [--verbose]` | List built-in bundle templates |
| `aweskill bundle template import <name>` | Copy a built-in template bundle into the store |
| `aweskill bundle template install <name> [--override]` | Install every skill of a template from its recorded sources, then import the bundle; templates without sources fall back to plain import |
| `aweskill agent supported` | List all supported agent ids, mark global install status with `✓` / `x`, and show detected global skills paths |
| `aweskill agent add bundle\|skill ...` | Project managed skills into agent directories |
| `aweskill agent remove bundle\|skill ... [--force]` | Remove managed projections |
| `aweskill agent list [--global\|--project [dir]] [--agent <agent>] [--verbose]` | Read-only dry-run view of `doctor sync`: inspect `linked`, `broken`, `stale`, `locally-modified`, `duplicate`, `matched`, `new`, `external`, and `suspicious` entries (`external` marks directories another tool such as ctx manages; reported, never touched); when `--agent` is omitted, print the detected agent set for that scope before the grouped results |
| `aweskill agent recover` | Convert managed symlinks into full directories |
| `aweskill doctor sync [--apply] [--remove-suspicious] [--global\|--project [dir]] [--agent <agent>] [--verbose]` | Dry-run by default; add `--apply` to repair broken entries, relink duplicate / matched ones, and refresh stale copy projections (`locally-modified` copies are reported only and never overwritten; `external` entries are left alone), and `--apply --remove-suspicious` to also remove suspicious ones; when `--agent` is omitted, print the detected agent set for that scope first |
| `aweskill doctor clean [--apply] [--skills-only] [--bundles-only] [--verbose]` | Find suspicious non-store entries, grouped by `skills` and `bundles`, and optionally remove them |
| `aweskill doctor dedup [--apply] [--backup] [--delete]` | Find duplicate skills and optionally move or delete them; `--backup` copies the duplicates into `~/.aweskill/backup/dedup/` first |
| `aweskill doctor fix-skills [--apply] [--backup] [--include-info] [--skill <skill>] [--verbose]` | Inspect malformed `SKILL.md` frontmatter; actionable fixes include missing closing fences, invalid YAML rebuilds, added frontmatter, normalized names, and normalized descriptions; `--backup` copies original files into `~/.aweskill/backup/fix_skills/` before rewriting, `--include-info` adds non-rewritten informational checks, and `--apply` rewrites actionable fixes only |

<summary>find output and --domain / --stage filter details</summary>

`aweskill find` prefers to print `source` values that `aweskill store install` can use directly. When a provider returns a discover-only source such as `smithery.ai`, the result still appears, but `aweskill` marks it as unsupported for direct install and tells you to visit the matching `skills.sh` page so you can inspect the upstream installation instructions there. Local search results do not print install commands; they print the skill path and an `aweskill store show <skill>` hint instead. When searching both remote providers at once, `--limit` applies per provider before merge and dedupe.

`--domain` and `--stage` are sciskill-only filters. If you pass either flag with `--provider skills-sh`, `aweskill` now fails fast instead of ignoring the filter. When using `--domain` or `--stage` with sciskill, the value must exactly match the corresponding enum, including spaces and capitalization; invalid values also fail fast and print the allowed values.

## Awesome Ecosystem

aweskill is the skill manager at the center of a growing family of "awesome" tools built around AI coding agents — local-first and agent-operable.

Install the whole family in one command with the built-in `awe` bundle template — each skill still downloads from its own repository, so every project stays the single source of truth for its skill:

```bash
aweskill bundle template install awe
aweskill agent add bundle awe --agent claude-code
```
